Add motors into Misc array in constants
In Diagnostic Command, success/failure if statement might be too strict, check/change
(In the future, change the time condition in the diagonistic command 
    for motors with limited axi of rotation)
Check if diagonistic fail conditions work
Add solenoids to diagonistic command
When turning with extremes, the shaping delta is not proportional on both sides(+/-)
    Find solution
Eventually Smart Dashboard will be too full with success/failure statements from the Diagnostic command
    Print onle failures, instead of pending, success, and failures
